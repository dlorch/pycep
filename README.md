PyCep - Python Inception
========================

[PyCep](http://www.pycep.org/) is a Python interpreter in Python, created as a
study project to teach [myself](https://github.com/dlorch) about writing
interpreters.

Design Goals
------------

When writing PyCep, following design goals were kept in mind:

- PyCep should be fully language-compliant with CPython
- PyCep should use easy to understand concepts, patterns and algorithms rather than complicated ones
- PyCep should not rely on language-specific constructs of the host interpreter (CPython)
